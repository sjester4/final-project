        <p>Creating the web page for my final project was both exciting and challenging at times. I have lately really gotten into fitness and eating healthy. As college students or even those working full-time after college, it can be hard to maintain a healthy lifestyle. We all know eating healthy and being activity should some how be incorporated into our lifestyles but sometime life gets in the way. What I wanted my website to project is how it is still possible to live a healthy life even in the hustle and bustle of life.</p> 

       
        
        <p>Originally, I had many elaborate ideas on how to go about making a beautiful, easy on the eyes website. However, as I started to code and create using Brackets, I knew I was getting myself into a whole a lot of work. Starting to feel overwhelmed, I began to redesign how my website will look. I started to go for the simple look and style in order to accomplish what I wanted done. At first it was frustrating but I eventually got right back on track and feeling great about the work I was completing.</p> 

        
        
        <p>After I started working on the layout of my website, I need to figure out how I would style all the content I was putting into this. Because I was including pictures of different workouts, food and recipes I got the idea to have it look and feel almost like a Pinterest. I was using pinterest for a majority of my photos that I added onto my website and thatâ€™s is when I came up to model it after. It is almost like a pinterest site specifically designed for people who are looking for workouts and food related things.</p>

        
        
        <p>I created five pages for my website; a home page, a home workout page, a gym workout page, a healthy snack option and a healthy dinner recipe page. My home page is simple in the layout and is suppose to be just a welcome and what to expect coming to this website. I have the same background image throughout my whole website to add consistency. I added light green pattern because I wanted a background that was calming and not harsh on the viewers eyes. I wanted to make sure my website is appealing and does not distract the viewer from what I am trying to show off.</p> 

        
        
        <p>The next four pages I created for my website is where the more pinterest style of the website starts to come out. As mentioned before I created a home workouts page, a gym workouts page, a healthy snacks page and a healthy dinner recipes page. For the workout pages I added pictures I had collected and separated them into whether they are home or gym worthy. I made sure to add padding to the pages so while scrolling the pictures do not just sit right on top of each other. I also made sure for some of the picture that their size was large enough for someone to see immediately on the screen without any issues.</p>

        
        
        <p>Then we start to go into the food pages of my site. I separate them by whether it is a pre or post snack from the gym or whether someone is looking for something new to try during the day instead of reaching for the cookie. For the snacks, I added the picture for my page but then I linked the pictures to the actually site I got it from. This way if the viewer finds something they like they can simply go to another site and find out more.</p> 

        
        
        <p>For the healthy dinner recipes page, I did the same with linking the pictures I posted to the actual site where I had gotten it. Again this would be if the viewer likes how something looks from one of the pictures I posted that can immediately be redirected to the site and find the recipe to try out themselves.</p>  

        
        
        <p>For the pictures I used for the last two pages I added padding between each of them so again they were not sitting right on top of each other. For more of the styling I worked on the page besides the background image I tried adding cool fonts to the header and title. I used Google fonts to find a font style I liked and would add something creativity to my website. I was also able to add a favicon to the tab so whenever someone would visit my website it would appear on the tab need to the title.</p> 

        
        
        <p>Now, you might have been wondering how I was connecting all the pages I had created? That is where bootstrap came into place. I added the links to each of my pages in the header to start off. Then I added the tab components to each page and put in the html document so when you click on the tab it links you directed to the page I set it as. </p>
        
        
        
        <p>Overall, my website is not what I had originally planned on it to be but that is completely okay. I got some of the components down that I wanted and still was able to accomplish a lot in a short amount of time. Working on this definitely has made me more comfortable working and coding in html and adding cool backgrounds, colors, fonts, pictures with links and knowing more about bootstrap. In the end I am happy with the work I put into this website. Definitely has made me more interested in coding and working with it. </p>
